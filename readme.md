# Thai Chess JS
This is (going to be) thai chess opensource library.

## Roadmap
- [ ] implement by copying [chess.js](https://github.com/jhlywa/chess.js) algorithm but with thai chess rule (prove of concept)
- [ ] optimize existing code
- [ ] rewrite entrire library using bitboard (it has the best performance right now as far as I know)
