# Thai Chess JS
This is (going to be) thai chess opensource library.

## Todos
- [ ] attacked function
- [ ] inCheck / inCheckmate / insufficientMaterial / threefoldRepetition / ...
- [ ] refactor code
- [ ] replace [Ramda](https://ramdajs.com/) with regular js (because it make code hard to read and add friction in development process)
- [ ] [counting rules](https://www.chessvariants.com/play/makruk-thai-chess)
- [ ] make standard like [FEN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsyth%E2%80%93Edwards_Notation) / [PGN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Game_Notation) / [SAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_notation_(chess)) (maybe TFEN /TPGN / TSAN ?)
- [ ] write test (Why write test last? I don't know. I'm not familiar with TDD or any kind of tests so I will put it last to be more focused on chess algorithm.)
- [ ] release version 0.1.0 to npm
- [ ] decide what to do next. Maybe optimize existing code or rewrite entire library using bitboard.
