# Thai Chess JS
This is (going to be) thai chess opensource library.

## Todos
- [x] attacked (its name was changed to canThisColorAttackThisSquare) function
- [x] inCheck / inCheckmate / inStalemate / inThreefoldRepetition
- [ ] insufficientMaterial
- [ ] functional programming utility function like "compose" ...
- [ ] refactor code
- [x] replace [Ramda](https://ramdajs.com/) with regular js (because it make code hard to read and add friction in development process)

- [ ] import / export [PGN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Game_Notation)
- [ ] write test (Why write test last? I don't know. I'm not familiar with TDD or any kind of tests so I will put it last to be more focused on chess algorithm.)
- [ ] release version 0.1.0 to npm
- [ ] decide what to do next. Maybe optimize existing code or rewrite entire library using bitboard.
